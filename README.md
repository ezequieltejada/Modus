Frontend Practice.
Since it was a while from my last FrontEnd job, I needed some practice so I'll work on a PSD and create a template. It may not follow the best practices but I'll try to make it as ready for production as I can.

The PSD files were downloaded from www.webdesignerdepot.com I suggest to check them out.
